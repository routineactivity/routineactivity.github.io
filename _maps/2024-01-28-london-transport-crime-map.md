Quite often we see misleading takes on crime data in the media - one of those takes is the inspiration for a map layer I created and posted <a href="https://felt.com/map/btp-london-dNirKv9B9ASxmumRUvrkZvxD?loc=51.53461,-0.13169,12.08z&share=1" target="_blank">here on Felt</a>

The articles in question were published in numerous national and regional newspapers telling us of shocking rises in recorded crime on London's transport network - specifically the Underground. What had actually happened was that increases were in line with the return of passenger numbers following the pandemic as was <a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/who-we-are/what-london-assembly-does/questions-mayor/find-an-answer/violent-incidents-london-underground-1" target="_blank">explained here by the London Assembly</a>

For those interested you can read more about denominators in transport crime here: <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/neaxh" target="_blank">Solymosi et al (2017) Alternative denominators in transport crime rates</a>

The map layer created for Felt allows the user to explore violence and sexual offences across London's rail and underground stations.
