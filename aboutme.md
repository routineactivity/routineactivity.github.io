### Biography

I am currently a Data Scientist specialising in geographical information. My main interests are crime analysis, problem-solving and evidence-based policing. 

Operating for almost 20 years in the roles of community safety crime analyst, intelligence analyst, strategic analyst and data scientist, I have extensive experience in collating data and presenting compelling cases for innovation in frontline policing. I am an expert problem-solving practitioner who has developed analytical products to inform operational policing and decision-making. I have been awarded for analysis and problem solving having won the Tilley Award for Excellence in Problem-Oriented Policing (2012) and twice the Herman Goldstein Award for Excellence in Problem-Oriented Policing (2013, 2015).

My work has included the use of problem-solving analysis to inform situational crime prevention techniques addressing acquisitive crimes (including burglary and street robbery), machine learning [statistical forecasts](https://www.sebp.police.uk/2020-virtual-conference) to identify prospective perpetrators of weapon-enabled harm, and [risk-terrain modelling](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07418825.2023.2209163) to understand geographical contributors to patterns of serious violence and public space sexual offences. 

I maintain an open-source [website](https://sites.google.com/view/routineactivity/home?authuser=0) which provides a range of crime analysis tools and resources for use in crime prevention. This is to support those in public safety or policing roles who are interested in developing technical skills and learning methods that can be applied for the purpose of improving public safety.
