### Biography

I am currently a Data Scientist specialising in geographical information. My main interests are crime analysis, problem-solving analysis (and problem-oriented policing) and evidence-based policing, particularly for applying place strategies.

Operating for almost 20 years as a community safety crime analyst, intelligence analyst, strategic analyst and data scientist, I have extensive experience collating data and presenting compelling cases for innovation in frontline policing. I am an expert problem-solving practitioner who has developed analytical products to inform operational policing and decision-making. I have been awarded for analysis and problem solving having won the Tilley Award for Excellence in Problem-Oriented Policing (2012) and twice the Herman Goldstein Award for Excellence in Problem-Oriented Policing (2013, 2015).

My work has leveraged data and analysis to inform situational crime prevention techniques (including burglary, <a href= "https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9780429457357-5/gang-violence-enfield-london-lisa-tompson-kate-bowers" target="_blank">gang violence and street robbery</a>), machine learning <a href="https://www.sebp.police.uk/2020-virtual-conference" target="_blank">statistical forecasts</a> to identify prospective perpetrators of weapon-enabled harm, and <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07418825.2023.2209163" target="_blank">risk-terrain modelling</a> to understand geographical contributors to patterns of serious violence and public space sexual offences. 

I maintain an open-source <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/routineactivity/home?authuser=0" target="_blank">website</a> which provides a range of crime analysis tools and resources for use in crime prevention efforts. This is to support those in public safety or policing data roles interested in developing technical skills and learning methods that can be applied to improving public safety.
