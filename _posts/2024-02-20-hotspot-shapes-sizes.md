The recent Home Office <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hot-spot-policing-in-england-and-wales-year-ending-march-2022/evaluation-report-on-grip-and-bespoke-funded-hot-spot-policing#:~:text=Key%20findings,over%2080%2C000%20weapons%20were%20collected." target="_blank">Evaluation report on Grip and bespoke-funded hot spot policing</a> highlighted differences and challenges encountered by analysts in identifying the best hot spot shapes and sizes for their visible policing strategies. Ideally, we want places small enough and hot enough for police officer presence to generate an effect. This short article offers some thoughts when assessing the suitability of the shapes and sizes of hot spots for visible patrol.

This is a follow-up to a previous blog article which considered [crime counts versus crime harm](https://routineactivity.github.io/harm-index-and-hotspots/).

### Hot spot shapes

For Op. Grip, police forces had autonomy in determining their spatial units of analysis. A mixture of small grids (boxes or hexagons), Census administrative units (LSOA, Wards), bespoke polygons around hot streets and circular buffers around the central point of an LSOA were used. We can group these into three themes:
1.	Larger administrative boundaries (LSOA, Ward)
2.	Uniform micro-places (boxes, hexagons, circles)
3.	Street segments
   
**Advantages and disadvantages of each**

*Larger administrative boundaries*
* A. Corresponding socio-demographic and economic data aggregated to these same boundaries. This can help match similar places for experimental purposes (i.e. control and treatment comparisons).
* D. Often too large
* D. Most places within them have little or no crime
* D. Policing resources spread thinly which can mean low-intensity intervention dosage.
* D. Statistical bias from high-level aggregation

*Uniform micro-places*
* A. Uniformity limits statistical bias, the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7151983/#:~:text=We%20may%20define%20MAUP%20as,categories%2Fpolygons%20in%20geographical%20data." target="_blank">modifiable areal unit problem</a>
*	A. Can specify size and shape.
*	D. Do not reflect underlying geography and human behaviour patterns.
*	D. Cut-off or cut-through streets and hotspots that would naturally be part of a patrol.
*	D. May be difficult to generate a large enough number of places with sufficient crime (if the size is too small, or the crime problem is low volume) for a simple randomisation study.

*Street segments*
*	A. Represents a behavioural unit for analysis, consistent with how people use the space.
*	A. Large enough to offset imprecise geocoding.
*	A. Multiple adjoining hot segments can be clustered together to create larger behavioural units of analysis suitable for statistical blocking.
*	A. Can generate time estimates of how long it would take to patrol based on segment lengths. 
*	D. Cannot obtain socio-demographic and economic data at this level.
*	D. It May be difficult to generate a large enough number of segments with a sufficient volume of crime for a simple randomisation study (such as when the crime problem is low volume).
